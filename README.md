Hi. I'm Jonathan Rascher, and this is my resume. I've always written it in
LaTeX, and it seemed like a good exercise to start versioning it under Git so
I could easily back it up and share it online.

You probably don't want to build it yourself (just [download it][1]!), but if
you really want to try, grab a copy of [Latexmk][2] and run `latexmk -pdf` from
this directory.

Also, if such things interest you, the fonts used are the excellent
[Segan Light][3] and members of the very nice [PT Sans][4] family.
