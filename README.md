Hi. I'm Jonathan Rascher, and this is my resume. I've always written it in
LaTeX, and it seemed like a good exercise to start versioning it under Git so
I could easily back it up and share it online.

You probably don't want to build it yourself (just [download it][1]!), but if
you really want to try, you will need to copy
`jonathan-rascher-resume-public.tex.redacted` to
`jonathan-rascher-resume-public.tex` before `make all` will succeed. This is
necessary to enable me to keep two versions of my resume (one with my phone
number and mailing address included, and one with these data) without posting
too much private data to GitHub.
